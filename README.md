# PlotsViewer
A simple python GUI to view plots (images basically, can later be extended to direct plots) in an interactive manner

## Steps to use
- Keep the OutputFiles folder intact, and copy your plots there
- Make sure the images have .png extension
- Go to PlotsViewer folder and run the PlotsViewer.exe application

### That's it!!! Next steps would be to add any folder location in the GUI and see the plots from there
